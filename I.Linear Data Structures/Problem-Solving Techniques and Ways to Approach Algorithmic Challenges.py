#Good Problem-Solving Techniques:
    #Sovling algorithmic challenges is a great way to practices.

    #During the planning and anlysis phase it's common to use 
    #pseudocode to map out the necessary steps

#Pseudocode : high-level description of the alogorithm's logic 
    #that is general in nature and is not based on any specific 
    #programming language
        #Pseudocode is usually a mixture of a common written
        #languagelike English, with programming constructs
        #like IF, ELSE, FOR, and WHILE.

#That's where you will play a vital role as a developer.
    #you will need to choose the most efficient algorithm to solve the challenge

#Thinking through different available algorithms 
    #is an important problem-solving skill that you should practice.

#Consider different approaches 
    #their effciency,implications,and implementation

#"Am I covering all possible edge cases?":
    #Edge cases are  specific, valid inputs or conditions that 
        #occur at the boundaries of what an algorithm should handle.
