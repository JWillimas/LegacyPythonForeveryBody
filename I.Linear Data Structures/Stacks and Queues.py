#A stack is a Last-in, First-out (LIFO) data structure.
#"push" operation--add it to the top of the stack.
#"pop" operation--Removing an element from a stack
    #The time complexity of the push and pop operations is typically O(1)
    #a constant time complexity.
        #The space complexity of the push and pop operations is usually constant O(1).
        #This means that the amount of memory required to perform these operations 
        # remains constant regardless of the size of the stack.

#A queue is a First-in First-out (FIFO) linear data structure.
    #"enqueue" operation:Adding an element to the back of a queues
    #"dequeue"operation:Removing an element from the front of the queue
        #The time complexity of the enqueue and dequeue operations is O(1)
        #The space complexity of the enqueue and dequeue operations is usually constant O(1)
