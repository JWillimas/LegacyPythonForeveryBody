#Big O notation describes the worst-case performance
    #or growth rate
    #of an algorithm as the input size increases.

#dominate term

#O(1) Constant Time Complexity:
    #When an algorithm has constant time complexity, 
    #it takes the same amount of time to run, 
    #regardless of input size.

#O(log n) is known as "Logarithmic Time Complexity".
    # This means that the time required by the algorithm increases slowly 
    # as the input size grows. 

#O(n) is known as "Linear Time Complexity".

#O(n log n) is known as "Log-Linear Time

#O(n²) is known as "Quadratic Time Complexity".
