#These connections create a data structure that looks like a chain of nodes, 
# where each node stores data and a reference to the next node in the linked list.
    #a node is a single container(or box)in a linked list
    #Each node has two parts:
        #1.Data → the value you want to store
        #2.Reference → a link pointing to another node
            #In python a reference is simply a variable taht points to an object
